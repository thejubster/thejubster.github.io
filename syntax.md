We have at our disposal, all the usual markdown goodness.

Headings:

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

```
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

```

We can have horizontal-rules with `---`

We can:

1. List things orderly
2. But also...

* not so orderly
* as you can see

~~mistakes~~ aren't a problem when you can `~~use extra markdown bits~~`

We can be **bold** and *emphasise* our point, or we can be a bit more ^creative to be sure we're  Always being sure that we _underline_ the issues.


We can have tables | with headers | like this
--- | --- | :---:
Rows | can be | fun
Rows | can be | or not
